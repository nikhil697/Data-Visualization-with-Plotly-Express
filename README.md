# Data-Visualization-with-Plotly-Express

This R Markdown document contains code for visualizing Gapminder dataset using Plotly, a powerful interactive plotting library. The script creates various plots to explore trends in population, GDP per capita, and life expectancy across different countries and continents.

## Prerequisites

- Google Collab/Jupyter Notebook
- Plotly library (`pip install plotly`)

## Overview of Visualizations

1. **Top 10 Countries Table**

    - Displays a table showcasing the top 10 entries from the Gapminder dataset.

2. **Population of Canada Over Time**

    - Bar chart illustrating the population of Canada over the years.

3. **Population of Canada with Life Expectancy Color Mapping**

    - Bar chart with life expectancy color mapping for the population of Canada over the years.

4. **Scatter Plot - 2007 Data**

    - Scatter plot for the year 2007, showing the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy.

5. **Scatter Plot by Continent - 2007 Data**

    - Scatter plot for the year 2007, color-coded by continent, with size representing population.

6. **Animated Scatter Plot Over Time**

    - Animated scatter plot showing the changes in GDP per capita, life expectancy, and population over the years.

7. **Choropleth Map**

    - Animated choropleth map representing life expectancy across countries over the years.

## Notes

- The data used is from the Gapminder dataset, and the visualization is created using Plotly, providing an interactive and dynamic exploration of the data.

- Adjustments to the script can be made to explore different aspects of the dataset.
